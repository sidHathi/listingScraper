It was very nice to have a driveway to park our car. It’s an hour and 15 min to Manhattan with public transportation. We could hear footsteps from the upstairs unit, but it’s New York and what can you do? I still slept great. It was a very peaceful place to come back to after a very busy day in the city.

I had a good stay, the place was very comfortable, spacious and clean, a home away from home. The environment was peaceful, except for the loud banging coming from upstairs during the night and early morning and there was a cold draft coming from the bedroom windows. But other than that, everything was great. Lovely place with good amenities. I recommend this place and would stay again.

I enjoyed my stay at this location. It was very convenient. I only needed it to have a place to sleep since I was out most of the time. The only take away I would say is that the internet was still hard to pick up on my phone and I could not receive calls. I'm not sure if that was due to being in the basement apartment of the home or if it was an app issue that perhaps the owner could look into to advise future guest how to setup their phones for calls. I would also like to see more up to date window treatments, bedding, and towels. Oh and the last thing, there is a knocking noise I heard in the wall of the bedroom but that may have been the radiator or heating system, I'm not sure. But overall it was a very good stay and I would use again.

Huvon's place was exactly as pictured and described - clean, spacious, warm and homely with excellent facilities in a peaceful area. My partner and I stayed here while on holiday for my birthday and we were both really comfortable and relaxed the whole time. Perfect overall and I'd definitely book again. Thanks, Huvon!

Huvon’s listing was exactly as described and was a beautiful space for both my husband and I to stay for the week. I made the mistake of forgetting to leave an extra set of keys that we’re given to us, but Huvon understood and I got it right back to him before leaving. This listing is very spacious and I would recommend it to anyone coming to the area.
